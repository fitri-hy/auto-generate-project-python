# Auto Generate Project
Creating Automatic Python Projects with the Help of AI.

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

This project aims to make it easier for users to create new Python projects quickly and efficiently. By using AI services, these projects can receive brief prompts about desired project goals or needs from users, and automatically generate the appropriate Python code base.
 
Then, the project will create a ready-to-use Python project file based on the generated code, as well as install any necessary libraries or dependencies automatically.
